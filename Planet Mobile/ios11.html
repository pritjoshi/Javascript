        <p>iOS 11 A giant step for iPhone. A monumental leap for iPad. iOS 11 sets a new standard for what is already the world’s most advanced mobile operating system. It makes iPhone better than before. It makes iPad more capable than ever. And now it opens up both to amazing possibilities for augmented reality in games and apps. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPad are the most powerful, personal, and intelligent devices they’ve ever been. Coming this fall
        </p>
        <p>
            iPad. Turned up to 11. iPad has always been a powerful way to work, play, and learn. And iOS 11 brings it to life like never before. New features and capabilities let you get more done more quickly and easily, making your iPad experience even more powerful and personal. Do with it what you will. Because now you can. Files. Wherever they are, they’re here. The new Files app brings all your files together. You can easily browse, search, and organize all your files in one place. And there’s a dedicated place for your recent files. Not just the ones on your iPad, but also those in apps, on your other iOS devices, in iCloud Drive, and across other services like Box and Dropbox. The new Dock. Bottom line, a more powerful way to work. The new Dock is a foundational change for iPad. It’s now available from any screen. So with just a swipe, you can open and switch apps instantly. And you can customize it with more of your favorite apps. The Dock also changes as you work. Intelligently suggested apps — like ones you opened recently and the last one you were using on your iPhone or Mac — appear in the right side of the Dock.

            Multitasking. Better in multiple ways. iOS 11 makes it easier and more intuitive than ever to multitask. You can open a second app right from the Dock, and both apps remain active in Slide Over as well as Split View. You can drag the second app in Slide Over to the left. And you can get back to your favorite App Spaces in the redesigned App Switcher. Drag and Drop. Give it a touch. Drag and Drop comes to iPad, allowing you to move text, photos, and files from one app to another. And because it’s been designed for the large Multi-Touch display of iPad, moving them around is pure magic. You can touch and move just about anything — or things — anywhere on the screen. Apple Pencil. More ways to make your mark. iOS 11 makes Apple Pencil for iPad Pro more versatile, powerful, and natural than ever. It’s more useful for all kinds of tasks, such as taking notes, getting work done, or simply being creative. Instant Markup Now you can mark up a PDF or screenshot faster and more easily. Step one, pick up your Apple Pencil. Step two, touch it to the screen. Step three, start writing. It’s called Instant Markup for a reason. Instant Notes Simply tap your Apple Pencil on the Lock screen and start taking notes immediately. Whatever you create is saved in the Notes app.

            Inline Drawing When you begin to draw or jot down something in Notes, the text around it can automatically move aside. And now handwritten words in Notes are searchable.1 It all happens on your device, so your private information stays that way. You can also add inline drawings in Mail. Scan and Sign The new Document Scanner in Notes automatically senses and scans a document, crops the edges, and removes any tilt or glare. Fill in the blanks or sign it with Apple Pencil, then save or share it easily. QuickType keyboard. Typing as quick as a flick. Letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation marks are now all on the same keyboard — no more switching back and forth. Just flick down on a key to quickly select what you need.2 Augmented reality. Apps that can change your world. iOS 11 introduces ARKit, a new framework that brings augmented reality to hundreds of millions of iOS devices by allowing developers to easily build unparalleled AR experiences. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, augmented reality takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways. Like never before, games and apps can offer fantastically immersive and fluid experiences that are out of this world, yet virtually within it. iPhone and iPad. More essential everyday essentials. iOS 11 makes iPhone and iPad so smart, they learn from you. So capable, they help you in more powerful and personal ways. And so in tune with you, they do things for you before you even ask. Apple Pay. Pay friends with a message. iOS 11 brings the convenience of Apple Pay to Messages. Now sending money to friends — and receiving it — is as simple as a conversation. Person to Person Messages. Get to apps with fewer taps. Now it’s even easier to get to all the fun. Share stickers, emoji, and games with your friends just by swiping across the totally redesigned app drawer. All the goodies, less effort. Siri. Naturally, more helpful. iOS 11 makes the world’s most popular intelligent assistant even more helpful. Through advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence, Siri is more expressive, with a new, more natural voice. Translation Personal DJ Ask Siri in English how to say something in Chinese, Spanish, French, German, or Italian, and Siri will translate the phrase.5 Like your hotel room in Rome? Tell your host. “È fantastico!” Beta Apple Music knows your tastes. So when you tell Siri to play some music, you’ll hear a song you love. Or a song you’re going to love. Siri can also answer music trivia questions like “Who’s the drummer in this song?” Smarter about you. Smarter for you. Siri has always been more than a voice. With iOS 11, Siri is even more helpful. It learns from you and is able to anticipate what you want and make suggestions before you even ask. And everything about you is encrypted end-to-end, so your personal information remains private. News QuickType Safari As Siri learns which topics you’re interested in, they’ll be suggested in News — making News even better at finding stories that matter to you. As you type, Siri can suggest names of movies, places — anything you’ve recently viewed. If you tell a friend you’re on your way, Siri can even suggest your estimated arrival time. Siri now suggests searches in Safari based on what you were just reading. And when you confirm an appointment or a flight on a travel website, Siri asks if you want to add it to your calendar.
